VS

:O --> GROUP BY can be used without an aggregation function in the SELECT statement!!!
It's because we're only using product_id and product_name both in SELCT and GROUP BY!!


SELECT
	product_id,
	product_name
FROM
	Product
JOIN
	Sales USING (product_id)
GROUP BY
	product_id, product_name
HAVING
	MIN(sale_date) >= DATE('2019-01-01')
	AND MAX(sale_date) <= DATE('2019-03-31')
