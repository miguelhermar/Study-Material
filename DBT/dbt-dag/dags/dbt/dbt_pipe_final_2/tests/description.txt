There are two ways of defining data tests in dbt:

- A singular data test is testing in its simplest form: If you can write a SQL query that returns failing rows, you can save that query in a .sql file within your test directory. It's now a data test, and it will be executed by the dbt test command.
- A generic data test is a parameterized query that accepts arguments. The test query is defined in a special test block (like a macro). Once defined, you can reference the generic test by name throughout your .yml filesâ€”define it on models, columns, sources, snapshots, and seeds. dbt ships with four generic data tests built in, and we think you should use them!

 # In this specific folder there are only singular tests. The generic tests are found within the marts folder.

 # Tests help ensure the data integrity and consistency of a table, by enforcing rules on the data values in each column.
